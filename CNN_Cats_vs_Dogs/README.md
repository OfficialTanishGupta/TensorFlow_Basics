## Cats vs Dogs Image Classifier (TensorFlow)

### Tech Stack

- TensorFlow / Keras
- CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
- Google Colab
- Matplotlib

### Features

- Image classification using deep learning
- Batch normalization & dropout to prevent overfitting
- Accuracy & loss visualization
- Trained on Cats vs Dogs dataset

### Model Architecture

- 3 Convolutional Blocks
- Batch Normalization
- MaxPooling
- Dense + Dropout
- Sigmoid Output Layer

### Overfitting Handling

- Applied real-time data augmentation (flip, rotation, zoom)
- Reduced generalization gap between training and validation

### Phase 2: Data Augmentation

- Applied random flipping, rotation, and zoom
- Reduced overfitting significantly
- Improved validation stability and accuracy
- Demonstrated better generalization performance

### Results

- Achieved high accuracy on validation data
